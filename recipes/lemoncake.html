    <p>This lemon pound cake is the ultimate dessert for lemon lovers. Lemon zest and lemon juice are added to the batter, 
        which lightly perfume the cake with lemon. Then, while the cake is still warm from the oven, I douse it with lemon 
        syrup to further enhance the lemon flavor. Finally, I drizzle the cake with a tart lemon glaze, which adds a pop of 
        intense lemon flavor to every bite.</p>

    <p>The cake can be made in a Bundt pan or two 8½ x 4½-inch loaf pans. Before deciding which pans to use, please see the 
        notes at the bottom of the recipe. The cake keeps well for days on the countertop, and it freezes well, too. Many thanks 
        to my longtime reader Karen Tannenbaum for inspiring the recipe.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <h5>For The Cake</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk (low fat is fine)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated lemon zest, packed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2-1/4 cups granulated sugar, plus more for the pan</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For The Syrup</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For The Glaze</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Farenheit and set an oven rack to the middle position. </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. </li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together buttermilk, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Set aside</li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or beaters), cream the butter and sugar on medium 
            speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat in the eggs one at a time, 
            beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low speed, beat in one-quarter of the flour mixture, then one-third of the buttermilk mixture. Beat 
            in another quarter of the flour, then another third of the buttermilk mixture. Repeat with another quarter of the flour 
            and the remaining buttermilk mixture. Finally, beat in the remaining flour mixture. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, 
            and give a quick mix to make sure all of the ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
        <li>(See note below before completing this step.) Thoroughly grease a 10-inch Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray or 
            vegetable shortening, making sure to get into all the crevices. Coat the greased pan generously with granulated sugar, 
            making sure the entire surface of the pan is evenly coated. </li>
        <li>Spoon the thick batter into the prepared Bundt pan and smooth with a rubber spatula. Bake for 65 to 75 minutes, or 
            until the cake is golden and a tester comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Set the cake on a cooling rack. Carefully run an offset spatula or table knife around the edges of your pan, between 
            the pan and the cake, to loosen the cake from the pan (don't forget the center tube). Cool the cake in the pan for 
            ten minutes. (Set a timer because if it stays in the pan too long, it may stick.)</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the syrup. Combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and 
            stir in the lemon juice. </li>
        <li>Invert the warm cake onto a rack. Slip a large piece of parchment paper, aluminum foil, or paper towels under the 
            rack for easy clean-up. Gradually brush the hot syrup over the cake, letting it soak in (a little syrup will drip off, 
            but try not to rush so that most of it is absorbed). Allow the cake to cool completely, about one hour.</li>
        <li>When the cake is cool, carefully transfer it to a serving platter. To make the glaze: in a medium bowl, whisk together 
            the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice. Add more confectioners' sugar or lemon juice as necessary to make a thick but 
            pourable glaze (it should be a little thicker than you'd think, about the consistency of molasses or honey). Spoon the 
            glaze over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong>You'll need 4-5 lemons for the entire recipe</li>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong>As the recipe indicates, I grease the Bundt pan with vegetable shortening and then dust it with sugar. 
            It has always worked beautifully for me, but a number of readers have mentioned problems with the cake sticking. If you’d 
            prefer to use a different method, treat the pan by generously coating it with butter and then dusting it with flour, or use 
            a nonstick baking spray with flour like Pam with Flour or Baker’s Joy. (Also, it's best not to use a Bundt pan with an 
            intricate design for this cake, as they are more prone to sticking.) Another option (that is foolproof) is to use two 
            8½ x 4½-inch loaf pans instead of a Bundt pan. Loaf pans are much less prone to sticking, and you can line them with parchment 
            paper for extra insurance. To prepare the loaf pans, spray them with nonstick baking spray, line the bottoms with parchment, 
            and then spray them again. The bake time will be 50 to 60 minutes, and you will only need half of the soaking syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Freezer Friendly Instructions:</strong>The cake can be frozen (without the glaze) for up to 3 months. After it 
            is completely cooled, double-wrap it securely with aluminum foil or plastic freezer wrap, or place it in a heavy-duty 
            freezer bag. Thaw overnight on the countertop before serving. (Add the syrup before the cake is frozen and add the glaze 
            after the cake is thawed.)</li>
    </ul>
