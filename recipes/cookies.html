    <h3>Recipe courtesy of Bon Appetit</h3>
    <p>This recipe set my new standard for chocolate chip cookies. The combination of brown butter, flakey salt, and dark chocolate
        make for a delicious, adult version of a classic chocolate chip cookie. The toffee adds enough sweetness to balance the salt,
        and browned butter just makes everything more delicious.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>227g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>250g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li>215g dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>73g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>80g chocolate toffee bars, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>216 chocolate wafers, 72% cacao</li>
        <li>Flakey sea salt for finishing</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until it foams, then browns, 5–8 minutes. Scrape into a 
            large bowl and let cool slightly, until cool enough to touch (like the temperature of a warm bath), about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk flour, baking soda, and kosher salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add brown sugar and granulated sugar to browned butter. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat until incorporated, 
            about 1 minute. Add eggs and vanilla, increase mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until mixture lightens and begins to 
            thicken, about 1 minute. Reduce mixer speed to low; add dry ingredients and beat just to combine. Mix in toffee pieces and 
            chocolate wafers with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Let dough sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes to allow flour 
            to hydrate. Dough will look very loose at first, but will thicken as it sits.</li>
        <li>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375. Using a 1-oz. ice cream scoop, portion out balls of dough and place on a 
            parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing about 3" apart (you can also form dough into ping pong–sized balls with your hands). 
            Do not flatten; cookies will spread as they bake. Sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies until edges are golden brown and firm but centers are still soft, 9–11 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets 10 
            minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough and a fresh parchment-lined 
            cooled baking sheet.</li>
    </ol>
